Story:

	Ever wondered where the gods take their mighty power from ? I'm warning you, you mighty be shocked ! They grow it from heaven plants ! Well, not exactly, they have it grown, by people like you ! They're quite busy most of the time... you know... gods stuff ! Anyway, nice to meet you, from now on I'll be your agent and I will find you a job in these mighty lands. Just choose a god you want to work for and I'll get back to you !

	Oh, good choice ! Sooooo, there is a lot of work ahead and now i'm going to teach you the basics. In their early moments, gods and goddesses aren't so powerful, they only have one piece of mighty land and enough mighty dust to grow one plant. Overtime, plants create mighty dust. And that moment, that little sparkle of creation, that's where your god's mighty power comes from. The more your plants create mighty dust, the stronger your god gets. So go on, use the mighty dust to create mighty lands and plants, and let your all mighty god be magnificent.
